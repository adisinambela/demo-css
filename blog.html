    Gion Matsuri is a one of the most famous festivals in Japan. It takes place during the entire month of July, but the highlight is the grand procession of floats called "Yamaboko Junko" on the 17th and 24th. It takes place on the Kawaramachi and Oike Streets.
    The Gion Matsuri is not just Kyoto’s biggest festival – it’s one of Japan’s biggest annual events. Originally held to pray for deliverance from plague, the festival has evolved into a huge celebration of Kyoto culture. It’s also a huge summer block party in which locals and visitors gather to promenade in colorful yukata robes and gorge themselves on street food and beer. The main events are two processions of traditional parade floats, held on 17 July and 24 July.
    However, for visitors, perhaps the most enjoyable part of the festivals are the “Yoi-yama” events held on the three evenings preceding the main float processions. This is when Kyoto really lets loose. If you can lay your hands on a yukata why not get dressed up and enjoy the fun? On this page, I’ll give you all the details on the festival and advice on how to enjoy it. Before you read any further, note that you will have to reserve accommodation months in advance if you hope to stay in Kyoto when the festival is on.

    This is the largest traditional dance festival in Japan. Men, women and children dance on almost all of the streets in Tokushima City, from the 12th to the 15th of August.  They wear summer cotton kimono and straw hats. More than a million people get together for this festival, and it is a spectacular sight. You can even join them to dance with the rhythmic music!
    This Tokushima festival features folkdances performed to welcome the souls of ancestors in the Bon season. It is well known throughout Japan for these words, which are voiced to set the rhythm, regardless of their meaning: 'It's a fool who dances and a fool who watches! If both are fools, you might as well have fun dancing!`. The dance dates back to 1587 when the feudal lord Hachisuka Iemasa (1558-1638), in celebration of newly-built Tokushima Castle, offered sake to the people of the castle town; the citizens became so drunk they started to dance in an unsteady gait. Awa is the former name of Tokushima. The Awa-Odori is characterized by irregular steps and by the jovial and energetic up-tempo rhythm. Separated into groups of men and women, the dancers parade through the city while dancing to music played on drums, gongs used when praying to Buddha and at festivals, three-stringed Japanese musical instruments, and flutes. The basic rule of this dance is to move your right arm forward with your right leg and your left arm forward with your left leg in turns to the two-beat rhythm.</p>
